What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository structure and hidden directories are created so that the
directory can act as a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to stage specific changes/files before committing
this allows you to ensure that you are committing only what you intend to,
and allows you to review the changes before making and psuhing a new
commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

By explicitly adding the changes that you need to a commit, then committing.
Seperating changes into multiple commits as needed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branching is useful when working on stories that span mutiple logical commits
or significantly diverge/break master. Untilately one should never be
committing directly to master, but rather to a develop branch, then pulling
branches out of develop for changes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
