When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To be able to work with others, to have an offsite backup. Perhaps to
    have a publically available remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually ensures that you have a static work environment

    even be advantageous at times to have a branch only for your work if
    the codebase is undergoing significant changes.
