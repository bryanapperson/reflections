When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To be able to work with others, to have an offsite backup. Perhaps to
    have a publically available remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually ensures that you have a static work environment
    where unexpected changes will not interrupt your workflow. It may
    even be advantageous at times to have a branch only for your work if
    the codebase is undergoing significant changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repository hosted on github. A clone is a copy
    that may be to your local machine or another machine of an entire
    git repository. A branch is a branch within a given git repository.
    A fork is useful for making a copy of a project on github. A clone
    is useful fopr thing such as downloading a repo to your local box.
    A branch is useful for doing work in an isolated part (branch) of a
    repo so that changes can be made and collaboration can occur at
    merge.
